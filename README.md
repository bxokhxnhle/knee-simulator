BME 411 Final Project
The objective of this project is to minimize the cantilever beamâ€™s length while ensuring that the required force is produced at a certain desired angular displacement.
Genetic Algorithm, Differential Evolution Algorithm and MATLAB's fmincon were used to optimize the beam's length.
